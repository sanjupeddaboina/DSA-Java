/* Celebrity Problem : A celebrity is a person who is known by everyone else at the party but does not know anyone in return. 
Given a square matrix M of size N x N where M[i][j] is 1 if person i knows person j, and 0 otherwise, determine if there 
is a celebrity at the party. Return the index of the celebrity or -1 if no such person exists.
